# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview

In this ,odule, we learnt to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup and also to scrape various types of information such as HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
